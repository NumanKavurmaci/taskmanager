Libraries:

1. Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python that handles routing, request handling, and templating.
2. SQLAlchemy: A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that simplifies working with databases, defining models, and performing database operations.
3. Passlib: A password hashing library for Python that provides secure password hashing algorithms and utilities for password hashing, verification, and other password-related operations.
4. Flask-Login: An extension for user authentication and session management in Flask applications, handling user logins, sessions, and authentication management.
5. Flask-Bcrypt: An extension that integrates the bcrypt password hashing algorithm with Flask, simplifying the process of securely hashing and verifying passwords.

Database tables:

1. User Database: Stores information about the users of the tool, including usernames, hashed passwords, email addresses, and other relevant user details.
2. Task Database: Stores information about the tasks in the system, including task titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, statuses, assigned users, and any other relevant task-related data.
3. Project Database: Stores project-specific information if the task management tool supports multiple projects, such as project names, descriptions, start dates, end dates, and other project-related data.
4. Comment Database: Stores comments or discussions related to tasks, including the comment content, timestamps, and the associated task or project.
5. Notification Database: Stores notification data sent to users, including notifications, timestamps, notification types, and any other relevant notification information.
6. Teams Database: Stores information about the teams in the system, including team names, descriptions, team members, roles within the team, and any other

Relationships between the tables:

User Database:

1. The User Database table is linked to the Task Database table through the assigned users column. Each task can have one or more assigned users, and the assigned users are referenced by their unique identifiers from the User Database table.
Task Database:

2. The Task Database table is linked to the User Database table through the assigned users column. This column references the unique identifiers of the users assigned to a particular task.
The Task Database table may also have a foreign key relationship with the Project Database table if tasks are associated with specific projects. In this case, the Project Database table would have a primary key, and the Task Database table would have a foreign key referencing the project's unique identifier.
Project Database:

3. The Project Database table may have a one-to-many relationship with the Task Database table. This means that a project can have multiple associated tasks, while each task belongs to only one project. The Project Database table would typically have a primary key, and the Task Database table would have a foreign key referencing the project's unique identifier.
Comment Database:

4. The Comment Database table is associated with either the Task Database table or the Project Database table, depending on the scope of the comments. Each comment is linked to a specific task or project using a foreign key that references the unique identifier of the corresponding task or project.
Notification Database:

5. The Notification Database table can be associated with the User Database table to store notifications sent to users. Each notification would be linked to a specific user using a foreign key that references the user's unique identifier.
Teams Database:

6. The Teams Database table can be associated with the User Database table to store information about team membership. Each user can be a member of one or more teams, and the Teams Database table would include foreign keys referencing the unique identifiers of the users and teams involved.
